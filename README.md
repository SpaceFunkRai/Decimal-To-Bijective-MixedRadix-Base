# Decimal-To-Bijective-MixedRadix-Base
A small C# script I originally made to convert decimal integers to a spicy base 60 numerical system I made for my world-building, extended to allow for more bases ;3

The code was originally built to run on the command-line, but it should be quick and easy to repurpose for basically anything ;p

~~I don't even know if anyone will ever need this lol~~
